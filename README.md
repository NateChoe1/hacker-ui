# hacker-ui
This is a fake hacking "ui" to make it look like you're hacking.

# Controls
Delete: Take a screenshot
Enter: Enter into the next phase (access granted message, tree with "files", searching through the files with a file not found message)
Tab: Show access denied message
There aren't any more controls so feel free to keymash and then slam the enter key.
